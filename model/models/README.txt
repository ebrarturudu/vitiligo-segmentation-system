# Model Weights

This directory is intentionally left empty.

Trained model weights are not included in the repository due to size and licensing constraints.

To run inference:
- Download the required SAM checkpoint (e.g. sam_vit_b.pth)
- Place it in this directory
- Update the model path in the configuration if necessary
